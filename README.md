arduino-UART-client
==================

This is a library for the AllThingsTalk ‘Internet of Things’ platform.  

There are 2 parts to this library: an ino file that runs as firmware on a wifi module (like the [esp8266](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_-_UART_WiFi)) and a library that allows you to communicate over a serial connection to this wifi module 

### Installation
  1. Download the [source code](https://github.com/allthingstalk/arduino-UART-client/archive/master.zip)
  2. copy the content of the 'libraries' directory in the zip file to your arduino libraries folder (usually found at &lt;arduinosketchfolder>/libraries).

### Installing firmware
See [detaills](https://github.com/allthingstalk/arduino-UART-client/tree/master/ATT_IOT_UART/esp8266Firmware) for more info.
  
### Example sketches

The library includes a number of example sketches which demonstrate how assets of different types can be used with the AllThingsTalk ‘Internet of Things’ platform and also includes examples to be used with other boards.
