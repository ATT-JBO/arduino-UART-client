Arduino UART Demo Sketch. This Sketch is made for an Genuino 101 IoT board with a Grove
UART WiFi module based on the popular ESP8266 IoT SoC to communicate to the AllThingsTalk
IoT developer cloud.
The Grove UART WiFi module has firmware installed which includes the ATT_IOT library. It
communicates through Serial1 of the Genuino 101 board.

Version 1.0 dd 26/12/2015

This sketch is an example sketch to deploy the Grove Relay (103020005) to the
AllThingsTalk IoT developer cloud.


### Instructions
1. Setup the Arduino hardware
  - Use an Arduino Genuino 101 IoT board
  - Connect the Arduino Grove shield, make sure the switch is set to 3.3V
  - Connect USB cable to your computer
  - Connect a Grove Relay to pin D2 of the Arduino shield
  - Grove UART wifi to pin UART (D0,D1)
2. Add 'ATT_IOT_UART' library to your Arduino Environment
     More info can be found at http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries
3. Fill in the missing strings (deviceId, clientId and clientKey) in the keys.h file
4. Optionally, change sensor names, labels as appropiate
5. Upload the sketch

Note: for use of extra actuators, extend the callback function at the end of the sketch
